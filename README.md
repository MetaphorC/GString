# GString
My attempt at writing a clone of [**grep**](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/grep.c) in Rust. This is just for the sake of learning, don't know what I will do with this small project in the future, maybe nothing.

Notice - Any and all innuendos with the repository name are unintended.
